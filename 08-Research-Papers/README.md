# 08. Essential AI Agent Research Papers 📚🕵️‍♂️

The foundational research that defined the logic and architecture of autonomous agents.

## The Reasoning Revolution
1.  **ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (2022)**: The absolute foundation. It introduced the Thought-Action-Observation loop. [Read Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)
2.  **Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models (2022)**: The paper that proved "Thinking step-by-step" works. [Read Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)

## Advanced Logic & Planning
3.  **Reflexion: Language Agents with Iterative Self-Reflection (2023)**: How agents can learn from their own mistakes during a task. [Read Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366)
4.  **Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models (2023)**: [Read Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601)

## Multi-Agent & Future
5.  **CAMEL: Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Language Model Society (2023)**: Early work on agents talking to each other. [Read Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760)
6.  **AutoGPT & BabyAGI (Viral GitHub Projects)**: While not formal papers, these implementations popularized the concept of "unbounded" autonomous agents in 2023.
